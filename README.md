This word processor provides a range of features. To begin with, there's a menu bar featuring four menus:

    File -> Open (Loads a file from the computer)
    File -> Save (Saves the current file anywhere on the computer)
    File -> Exit (Closes the program)

    Edit -> Cut (Removes the selected area)
    Edit -> Copy (Duplicates the selected area)
    Edit -> Paste (Inserts the selected area)

    Review -> Word Count (Calculates the number of words and characters in the text area, displaying the count at the bottom of the screen)

    Help -> About Us (Provides information about the author)

Following the menu bar, there are various buttons such as Bold, Italics, Left Align, and Right Align. Below them, there's a font selection box displaying available fonts in Java, alongside a font size box offering different sizes. Users can choose fonts and font sizes according to their preferences.

Next, there are fields for find and replace functionalities, which operate based on the selected buttons beneath them. Below this is the main text area.

Finally, there are word count and character count displays, which update after selecting 'Word Count' from the Review menu.
